	 *  Constructors -> creating Objects
	 *  Destructors  -> destroying Objects
	 *  
	 *  why java not provoided desctructors ?
	 *  
	 *  -> unlike c/cpp destructors where not provided in java. Because it will be 
	 *     taken Care by "Garbage Collector". In c++, devoloper must destroy the 
	 *     Object created but not used/after use.
	 *  
	 *  which memory management is Good across PL?
	 *  
	 *  Java, because devoloper need not to destroys any object. So less complexity & Good memeory management
