public class _9_Features {
	/*
	 * Features:
	 * 
	 * 	1. Simple PL:
	 * 	--------------
	 * 		-> Less Memory & Less Execution Time
	 * 		-> Java Don't adapt complex features (pointers, multiple inheritance, operator overloading)
	 * 		-> Syntax is same like C/CPP to adapt easily (simplified)
	 *  
	 *  2.OOPL:
	 *  --------------
	 *  	-> Object Oriented Program Language, java provoides Option to provoide Data in Objects
	 *  
	 *  3.Platform Independent:
	 *  -----------------------
	 * 		-> it provoided option to compile program in One OS and Able to run on Another OS
	 * 
	 *  4.Arch nuetral:
	 *  ----------------------
	 *  	-> It provoided Option Hardwar Independent.
	 *  
	 *  5.Portable:
	 *  ----------------
	 *  	-> Java will run on All OS and All Hard ware Component, SO it is Portal
	 *  	-> Java able to provoide Fixed memory allocation for datatypes, irrespective of OS & H/W.
	 *  
	 *  6.Robust:
	 *  ----------------
	 *  	-> Memory management is well maintained using Heap Memory management Syste (dynamic memory management)
	 *  	   so it will allocate and deallocate @runtime
	 *  	-> Exception Handling were very well maintained in Java
	 *  
	 *  7.Dynamic:
	 *  ---------------
	 *  	-> Primitive Data Types Allows Memory Allocation at Runtime is Dynamic Programming Language.
	 *  	-> Java Allocates Memory in Runtime Not in Compile Time.
	 *  
	 *  8.Secure:
	 *  ---------------
	 *  	-> 3 Level Of Security
	 *  		-Implicit Security : In JVM, Java Provoided Security Manager
	 *  		-Web Security : Java Provoided JAAS[java Auth Authroization Service] to ensure Web Securtiy
	 *  		-Network Security Java Provoided Network Security Alogorithm to ensure Network Security
	 *  
	 *  9.MultiThead:
	 *  ---------------
	 *  	-> Java Provoided Single and Multiple Thread Model to Ensure Perfomance
	 *  	-> Adv: Parallel Execution
	 *  
	 *  10.Distributed PL:
	 *  ------------------
	 *  	-> Java Provoided Separate Module called "J2EE/JEE" for a Distributed Applications, 
	 *  	   So Java is Distributed PL.
	 *  	
	 *  11.Intrepretive:
	 *  ----------------
	 *  	-> Java is Both Compilative And Interpritive programming Language
	 *  	-> Inside JVm a compilation and Interpretaion will Occur, it will Convert High Level Representation 
	 *  	   to Low Level Represention.
	 *  	-> JavaC is Compiler
	 *  
	 *  12.High Performance PL:
	 *  -------------------------
	 *  	-> Rich Set Features : Robust, Distributed, Portable
	 *  	-> Internal Components like JIT Compiler
